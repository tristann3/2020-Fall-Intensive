# 2020 Fall Intensive

This is a small scale app that lets users type in their name to ear the pronunciation by leveraging the NameCoach API
This API key will expire 10/21/2020

The big idea behind this projects is for doctors/teachers to be able to say their patiens/students name correctly.

# How to use

Enter your name, when the text box loses focus, the API call will be made, updating the dropdown and allowing the user to hear a pronunciation of their name
